# crudLaravelVue
This is a Laravel 5.6 and VUE.js Crud.


It is a simple CRUD for a form, this is a smaller version of a Company register, as you see in the code there is no api authentication, so if you want to do this in a "production" enviroment, you must set your OWN SECURITY METHODS.


Maybo soon I will upload a Laravel Passport API Demo.


THANKS
